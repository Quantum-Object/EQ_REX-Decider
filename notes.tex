an NFA is :
1 a list of integers Q: states
2 map (int,list(int)) this should work as f (function for transition)
3 list A (accepted states)

HOW TO turn a Rex to a NFA 
(1|0)*(1*)


------

functions:
1.union : 
on input m:
    
2.not   :
3.inter : use union and not (that is inter(a,b)=not(union(not a,not  b)))
IDK about time complexity but it is not O(2^n)
4.E_NFA(NFA X)


now if we have NFA1 and NFA2  we can get 
to get the (A^not(B)) U (not(A) ^ B)= C
so this is as follows:
union (inter(a,not b),inter (b,not a))

OK now :
